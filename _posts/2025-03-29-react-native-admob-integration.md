## Why Use AdMob in React Native?
Google AdMob allows you to monetize your mobile apps by displaying ads. In this guide, we will integrate AdMob into a React Native project for iOS and Android both. Integrating AdMob into a React Native app can be challenging, especially with Android build issues. In this tutorial, I share a step-by-step guide to successfully setting up AdMob for both iOS and Android, along with my workaround to a common Android build problem.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- React Native CLI installed
- Firebase account (for AdMob setup)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run the following command:
```bash
npm install react-native-google-mobile-ads@13.3.1

Next, link the package:
cd iOS && npx pod-install && cd..

## Step 2: Update App.json like;

After installing the package properly by saying pod install, you should do the following step for both android and ios.

ðŸ“Œ Add the app ids you created in app.json. It is important to add them completely.

{
  ...
  "react-native-google-mobile-ads": {
    "android_app_id": "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxx~xxxxxxxx",
    "ios_app_id": "ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxx~xxxxxxxx"
  }
}
If you have done these operations properly, we can now proceed to use it. 

Step 3: Configure Banner Ad From AdMob in App.js or in file of your choice.

```liquid

import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";
import { MobileAds } from "react-native-google-mobile-ads";

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    MobileAds().initialize();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <GAMBannerAd
        unitId={TestIds.BANNER}
        sizes={[BannerAdSize.FULL_BANNER]}
        onAdFailedToLoad={(error) => {
          // if anything goes wrong with Ad load this will show you exact reason
          console.log('Ad Failed to Load',error.message,error.name);

        }}
        requestOptions={{
        requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

```
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use test ads during development to avoid policy violations.

Step 4: Run app for Android and iOS
For Android:
npx react-native run-android 
For iOS:
npx react-native run-ios

Finally you will either get Ad on your simulator or it will show reason in console why its not showingup.
In case you are not getting console logs use;
# For Android:
npx react-native log-android
# Or, for iOS:
npx react-native log-ios
